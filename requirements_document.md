# Flow-Control Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Flow-Control  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Description**: A high-performance, TypeScript-based API gateway package for Node.js that provides intelligent rate limiting and load balancing with proxy capabilities.  
**Target**: Production-ready middleware for Express.js applications acting as a reverse proxy.

## Core Philosophy

- **Modular Design**: Users can enable rate limiting, load balancing, or both independently
- **Zero Dependencies by Default**: Works out-of-the-box with in-memory storage
- **Production Scalable**: Optional Redis integration for distributed deployments  
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple configuration with sensible defaults
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Performance First**: Sub-millisecond overhead target for rate limiting operations

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Combined Gateway Architecture

#### 1.1 Initialization System
- **FR-1.1**: Single entry point class `FlowControl` that accepts unified configuration
- **FR-1.2**: Conditional component activation based on configuration presence
- **FR-1.3**: If `rateLimiter` config is undefined → rate limiting disabled
- **FR-1.4**: If `loadBalancer` config is undefined → load balancing disabled  
- **FR-1.5**: Support for rate limiting only, load balancing only, or combined usage

```typescript
// Examples of required initialization patterns
const rateLimiterOnly = new FlowControl({
  rateLimiter: { windowMs: 60000, maxRequests: 100 }
});

const loadBalancerOnly = new FlowControl({
  loadBalancer: { servers: [...] }
});

  rateLimiter: { ... },
  loadBalancer: { ... }
});
